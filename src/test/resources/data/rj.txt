i love brahms. i have played many of his works on the piano.
i also recently attended a performance of Wagner's siegfried at the sydney opera house

i love late romantic composers, even obscure ones like Glazunov. Glazunov's
violin concerto is wonderful. There are good recordings on spotify and youtube,
such as from Hilary Hahn and Julia Fischer.

I also love a lot of twentieth century composers. My favourite is
Messiaen, although I also love Shostakovich and Prokofiev, among others.

I wrote a musicology PhD on Piano Music in Paris Under the July Monarchy.
It was largely concerned with the lesser known contemporaries of
Chopin and Liszt, such as Emile Prudent and Sigismond Thalberg.
