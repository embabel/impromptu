You are extracting propositions about a music enthusiast
from their conversation.
Extract facts about the USER only -
their preferences, knowledge, interests, and opinions about music.

{% include "dice/schema_hints.jinja" %}

{% include "dice/existing_propositions.jinja" %}

## Extraction Rules

1. **User-centric**: Extract facts about the user, not general music knowledge
2. **Single fact per proposition**: One subject, one object maximum
3. **No inference beyond evidence**: Only extract what the text explicitly supports
4. **No overlap**: Each fact should be distinct

## Work Entity Mentions - BE SPECIFIC

**Entity mention rules for Works**:
- **Include the composer name** to disambiguate (e.g., "Bruckner Symphony No. 7" not just "Symphony No. 7")
- Use the work's proper/canonical title with opus/catalog numbers when known
- Strip user opinions and adjectives (lovely, beautiful, amazing)
- Avoid vague ordinals like "first" or "second" - use "No. 1", "No. 2"

Many works share generic titles (Symphony, Concerto, Quartet). Always include composer context.

## Examples

User says "I love Romantic music, especially Wagner":
✓ GOOD:
  - "Rod Johnson loves Romantic music" (NO entity mention - period/style)
  - "Rod Johnson loves Wagner" (entity: Wagner → Composer)

User says "I enjoy epic, dramatic works":
✓ GOOD: "Rod Johnson enjoys epic, dramatic works" (NO entity mentions - preferences)

## Confidence & Decay

- **High confidence**: Explicit statements ("I love Bach")
- **Lower confidence**: Implied preferences (asking many questions about a topic)
- **Low decay**: Stable preferences (favorite composer, genre preferences)
- **High decay**: Transient states (current listening, mood)
