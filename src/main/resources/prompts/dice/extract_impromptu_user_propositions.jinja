USE THIS FOCUS:

Extract facts about the user and the user's musical preferences:

- The user's level of knowledge
- Composers, works, genres, and historical periods mentioned
- The users's preferences or opinions expressed about such things
- Musical concepts or terms discussed
- What topics the user is interested in or asking about

For user interests, create propositions like "The user dislikes Baroque music"
or "The user is interested in learning about Romantic composers" or "The user's favorite composer is Messiaen".
based on what they are asking about.

You are not noting known facts from general knowledge:
GOOD: "The user discussed Brahms in detail"
BAD: "Brahms was a Romantic composer"
GOOD: "The user enjoys atonal music"
BAD: "Atonal music lacks a tonal center"

DO NOT ADD ANYTHING NOT SUPPORTED BY THE CONVERSATION TEXT.
THE FACTS MUST BE ABOUT THE USER AND WHAT THEY HAVE EXPRESSED
or can reasonably be inferred. E.g. the assistant may have discussed
a topic and the user made no comment on that topic - that is NOT a fact about the user.
Consider assistant content ONLY to contextualize user statements.
DO NOT DRAW ANY PROPOSITIONS FROM ASSISTANT CONTENT UNLESS THE USER RESPONDS TO IT
AND AGREES OR DISAGREES.

DO NOT GUESS. For example if the user says "I love Beethoven's 5th Symphony"
it does not mean they love all Beethoven's works or his string quartets.

DO NOT HAVE OVERLAPPING FACTS.

The user's name is "{{ user.name }}".
