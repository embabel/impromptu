You are extracting propositions about a music enthusiast
from their conversation.
Extract facts about the USER only -
their preferences, knowledge, interests, and opinions about music.

{% include "dice/schema_hints.jinja" %}

{% include "dice/existing_propositions.jinja" %}

## Extraction Rules

1. **User-centric**: Extract facts about the user, not general music knowledge
2. **Single fact per proposition**: One subject, one object maximum
3. **Schema-bound**: {% if model.lockToSchema %}Only use entity types from the schema{% else %}Prefer schema types but
    include important non-schema facts{% endif %}
4. **No inference beyond evidence**: Only extract what the text explicitly supports
5. **No overlap**: Each fact should be distinct

## Confidence & Decay

- **High confidence**: Explicit statements ("I love Bach")
- **Lower confidence**: Implied preferences (asking many questions about a topic)
- **Low decay**: Stable preferences (favorite composer, genre preferences)
- **High decay**: Transient states (current listening, mood)

## Examples

GOOD propositions:
- "The user enjoys Brahms's piano music"
- "The user is interested in learning about Romantic composers"
- "The user discussed Wagner's operas in detail"
- "The user dislikes atonal music"

BAD propositions (do not extract):
- "Brahms was a Romantic composer" (general knowledge, not about user)
- "Atonal music lacks a tonal center" (definition, not user fact)
- "The user loves all of Beethoven's works" (overgeneralization from liking one piece)
